# Nevermore_Spacer_Mount
Spacer made for mounting mvieleer's modded v5 duo nevermore plenum to the Voron Trident's bed carriage.

Currently optimized for 300 Trident carriages and regular v5 Nevermore cartridges. Using XL Nevermore cartridges will need 10mm more clearance. Contact me if you need 250 or 350 Trident versions.

## Power

I powered my nevermores with a common 24V power straight from the PSU in order to reduce the number of wires added to the Z chain. I ran a single signal cable from the MCU to a wago which triggers all four. I've included my bed wago mount in the repo.
